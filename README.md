# Grading Functions #
This is a set of functions that I use when I am grading.

* __grades.summary.r__ - This function takes the path to a csv of grades and produces a histogram and compares it to a bell curve that has the same mean and sd.
* __grades.surface.r__ - This function takes the path to a csv of gradse and the path you wish to print to and produces a 3d surface of the number of points students earned per question.
